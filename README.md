# Time-Series-Regression

This project aims to utilize air quality data from the Hsinchu area for October to December 2021 to perform time series analysis and regression prediction of PM2.5 values. 

The data from October and November will be used as the training set, while December's data will serve as the test set. The features will include pollution data from the previous six hours, with the prediction targets being the PM2.5 values for the first and sixth hours into the future. Additionally, two models, namely linear regression and XGBoost, will be employed, and their corresponding Mean Absolute Errors (MAEs) will be calculated for evaluation.
